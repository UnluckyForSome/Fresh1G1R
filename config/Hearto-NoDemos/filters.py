# Retool command-line options (from Retool CLI documentation):
#
# Options:
# -c: Prefer titles with RetroAchievements (data source uses hashes from CHD/RVZ files for disc-based images)
# -d: Disable 1G1R filtering - ignore clone lists and treat each title as unique (not compatible with --legacy)
# -l: Filter by languages using a list (if a title doesn't support any of the languages on the list, it's removed)
# -n: Use local names for titles if available (e.g., Japanese characters instead of romanized names)
# -o: Prefer oldest production versions instead of newest (useful for speedrunners and those concerned about censorship)
# -r: Prefer regions over languages (forces strict adherence to region priority regardless of language support)
# -y: Prefer licensed versions over unlicensed, aftermarket, or homebrew titles
# -z: Prefer titles ripped from modern rereleases over original system releases (reverses default behavior)
# --compilations: How compilations should be handled (i=always prefer individual, k=keep both, o=optimize for least duplication)
# --nooverrides: Disable global and system overrides
#
# Outputs:
# --labelmia: Mark files as MIA with an mia="yes" attribute (don't use if you're a DATVault subscriber)
# --labelretro: Mark titles with a retroachievements="yes" attribute
# --listnames: Also output a TXT file of just the kept title names
# --machine: Export each title node using the MAME standard of <machine> instead of <game>
# --originalheader: Use the original input DAT file headers in output DAT files
# --output <folder>: Set an output folder where the new 1G1R DAT file/s will be created
# --regionsplit: Split the result into multiple DAT files based on region (not compatible with --legacy)
# --removesdat: Also output DAT files containing titles that were removed from 1G1R DAT files
# --replace: Replace input DAT files with Retool versions (not compatible with --output)
# --report: Also output a report of the titles that have been kept, removed, and set as clones
# --reprocess: Let DAT files be processed even if Retool has already processed them
#
# Debug:
# --config <file>: Set a custom user config file to use instead of the default
# --clonelist <file>: Set a custom clone list to use instead of the default
# --legacy: Output DAT files in legacy parent/clone format (not compatible with -d)
# --metadata <file>: Set a custom metadata file to use instead of the default
# --mia <file>: Set a custom MIA file to use instead of the default
# --ra <file>: Set a custom RetroAchievements file to use instead of the default
